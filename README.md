# tackle

Small workshop tools — TUIs you run in your own terminal. A `.tools` family
member. One Go monorepo; each tool is an independent binary under `cmd/`.

## Tools

- **scratch** — per-directory scratch notes with a live TUI.
- **proj** — agent-aware tmux session picker; the way *in* to a work session.
- **creel** — masked capture of an API key/secret into a local `.env`, so it never passes through an agent's chat. Run it bare (or via `prefix S`), or let the pi `request_secret` tool drive it. Consume a captured key with `creel exec NAME -- <command>`, which runs the command with the value in its environment only — never printed, never in the agent's context.
- **cull** — judges the tests an agent wrote, using TypeSafe's Jev, cuts the ones Jev is sure about, and puts the rest in front of you on a local page. (Preview.)
  Install: `kempt apply -manifest cmd/cull/kempt.toml -packages cull`, then `cull init` in each project.
- **sift** — audits the instruction files coding agents read (global files, repo files, skills), has the agent recommend one revised version per file, and puts each in front of you on a local page; what you approve becomes one pull request per repo. (Preview.)
  Install: `kempt apply -manifest cmd/sift/kempt.toml -packages sift`, then `sift skills install` and `sift init --root DIR`.
- **imprint** — guides a coding agent through publishing npm packages, trusted publishers and deprecation, opening each approval for you and checking every step on the registry.
  Install: `kempt apply -manifest cmd/imprint/kempt.toml -packages imprint`, then `imprint skills install`.

casebook moved to its own repo, https://github.com/subaud-tools/casebook (casebook.tools).

## Install

Prebuilt binaries are published per tool on each GitHub release
(`<tool>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`). Once tackle.tools is live, the supported install is:

    curl -fsSL https://tackle.tools/install.sh | sh -s scratch
    curl -fsSL https://tackle.tools/install.sh | sh -s proj
    curl -fsSL https://tackle.tools/install.sh | sh -s creel

Dev/fallback (requires a Go toolchain):

    go install github.com/subaud-tools/tackle/cmd/scratch@main
    go install github.com/subaud-tools/tackle/cmd/proj@main
    go install github.com/subaud-tools/tackle/cmd/creel@main

## proj

`proj` is an agent-aware tmux session picker — the way *in* to a work session.

### What it does

Open the picker with a bare `proj` and you get a Bubble Tea TUI that lists every
live tmux session across all per-project servers. Each row shows:

- the session name (`<project>/<work>`)
- which **agent** is attached (pi, claude, cursor, or blank)
- a **muster attention** indicator (glows when an agent wants a response)

A **preview pane** on the right shows the session's live terminal output.  A
configurable **sidebar** (pane layout, per-project toggle) sits beside the main editor
pane inside the chosen session.

Sessions live on **per-project tmux servers** (one server per project root), so
a crash or runaway in one project never takes down another.

### Restoring after a reboot

`proj` remembers every work session it sees in
`~/.local/state/proj/sessions.json`: its name, directory, agent, and the
agent conversation it holds (the `@harness_session` id that pi and Claude Code
announce). tmux hooks that `proj` installs on each of its servers keep the
record current as sessions are created, renamed, or switch conversation. The
record only grows: a reboot, a crash or a plain `tmux kill-session` leaves the
session restorable. Reaping it with `^x` in the picker is what removes it.

`tab` at the picker's entrance cycles **folders → sessions → saved**. The saved
scope lists every remembered session, grouped by the Ghostty window it sat in:

| Key | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `space` | check / uncheck the highlighted session (everything not open is checked by default) |
| `^r` | restore the checked sessions and rebuild their Ghostty windows and tabs |
| `enter` | restore just the highlighted session and jump to it |
| `^s` | save the current Ghostty window/tab layout (nothing records it automatically) |
| `^x` | forget the session (reaping it too if it is running) |

A restored session is recreated in its saved directory with its sidebar, and
its agent reopens the saved conversation (`pi --session <id>` /
`claude --resume <id>`). A session whose conversation file is gone shows
`(no transcript)` and starts a fresh agent under the same name. Unchecked
sessions stay saved for next time.

`proj` also understands non-interactive invocations that agents use safely:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `proj list --json` | Print all known projects and live sessions as JSON. |
| `proj current --json` | Print the current session's identity as JSON. |
| `proj new <project>/<work> --agent <name>` | Spawn a detached session (safe from inside an agent). |
| `proj sidebar` | Re-draw the sidebar for the current session (keybind target). |

See `.claude/skills/proj/SKILL.md` for the full agent-scope specification.

### Configuration

**Roots file** — unchanged from the original:

    ~/.config/proj/roots

One project root per line (blank lines and `#` comments ignored). Example:

    # work
    ~/GitHub/myapp
    ~/GitHub/infra

    # personal
    ~/GitHub/dotfiles

**Optional TOML config:**

    ~/.config/proj/config.toml

```toml
default_agent = "pi"          # what new work launches; "none" for a plain shell
default_model = "claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-8"  # global default in the model
                               #   picker (^d sets this live); a matching per-
                               #   project pin below wins over it
sidebar       = true          # auto-build the sidebar column on new work

[sidebar_layout]
panes = ["scratch", "yazi", "shell"]   # top → bottom
sizes = { scratch = 12, shell = 10 }   # rows; the middle pane fills

[model_providers]              # models offered in the new-work model list (Shift-Tab)
pi = ["claude-bridge", "openai-codex"]  # pi's menu = these providers' models,
                               #   discovered from `pi --list-models` (cached ~24h)
                               #   and launched as `pi --model <provider/id>`.
                               # claude's menu is built in (Anthropic models);
                               #   cursor/none take no model.

[project."bettor-help"]        # optional per-project overrides
default_agent = "claude"
default_model = "claude-sonnet-4-6"    # pin this project's model (matched
                               #   against the effective agent's menu)
sidebar       = false
```

All keys are optional; unset keys fall back to built-in defaults.

**Picking a model.** While naming new work, `Tab` cycles the agent (only a few)
and `Shift-Tab` opens a filterable list of that agent's models — type to filter,
`↑`/`↓` to move, `enter` to pick, `esc` to keep the current one. `^d` sets the
highlighted model as the global `default_model` (written to config.toml, marked
`★ default` in the list), so the picker opens on it next time. The new-work
footer shows the chosen model. Changing the agent re-seeds the model to that
agent's default. Claude Code only accepts Anthropic models, so its menu is a
built-in list; pi's menu is whatever providers you list under `[model_providers]`.
Selection order on open: a per-project `default_model` pin, else the global
`default_model`, else the menu's first entry.

### Shell shim + auto-join hook

`proj` needs a thin zsh shim so the shell can `eval` the one command the binary
cannot execute inside its own process (attaching a bare shell to a session on a
remote server). Source it from your shell rc:

```zsh
source ~/GitHub/schuettc/tackle/shell/proj.zsh
```

`shell/proj.zsh` defines:

- **`proj()`** — wraps the binary; evals the `exec tmux … attach` line it writes
  to `$PROJ_EXEC` for the out-of-band attach case.  All other cases (in-tmux
  switch, detach, agent commands) run in-process and leave `$PROJ_EXEC` empty.
- **`__proj_autojoin`** — fired once at source time.  If the shell is interactive,
  not already inside tmux, and `$PWD` is inside a known project root, it opens
  that project's picker automatically — so ⌘T in a Ghostty window (or any
  per-project terminal) lands straight on `proj`.  Opt-outs:
  - `NO_AUTO_TMUX=1` — per-shell
  - `~/.no-auto-tmux` — global
  - `AUTO_CLAUDE=1` — auto-join with claude preselected

### Cutover runbook

> **Operator-run only.** This plan does NOT perform these steps automatically.
> The cutover is deliberate and reversible — read all steps before starting.

The current dotfiles ship their own `proj` zsh function, `pt`, `tat`,
`bell-clear`, and `06-tmux-autojoin.zsh`.  Until those are removed/disabled the
zsh function shadows the binary, so **installing the binary changes nothing** —
which is why this runbook is a distinct, manual step.

**Step 1 — Install the binary**

```zsh
go install github.com/subaud-tools/tackle/cmd/proj@main
```

Verify: `which proj` should print something under `~/go/bin` (or your `$GOPATH/bin`).

**Step 2 — Source the shim from your shell rc**

Add to `~/.zshrc` (or equivalent):

```zsh
source ~/GitHub/schuettc/tackle/shell/proj.zsh
```

Reload: `exec zsh`. The shim wraps the binary and fires the auto-join hook.

**Step 3 — Remove / disable the old zsh shims**

Locate and remove (or comment out) from your dotfiles:

- the old `proj()` zsh function
- `pt` (project-tmux shorthand)
- `tat` (tmux-attach shorthand)
- `bell-clear` (post-attach bell cleaner)
- `06-tmux-autojoin.zsh` (or whichever file defines the old auto-join precmd)

Once these are gone, the `proj` name resolves to the shim → binary pipeline.
Reload again: `exec zsh`.

**Step 4 — Repoint the `prefix f` tmux keybind**

If your `tmux.conf` maps `prefix f` to `bin/proj-right-column.sh` (or similar),
change it to:

```
bind f run-shell "proj sidebar"
```

Then reload tmux config: `tmux source-file ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf` (or your
path).

**Step 5 — Verify**

```zsh
proj list --json        # should show your projects and any live sessions
proj current --json     # run from inside a tmux session
```

Open a new terminal window inside a project directory — it should land on the
`proj` picker automatically.

**Rolling back** — revert step 3 (re-enable the old functions) and step 2
(remove the `source` line). The binary stays installed and harmless.

## cull

cull looks at the tests an agent wrote and asks TypeSafe's Jev whether each one
is worth keeping. It cuts what Jev is sure of, and leaves the rest for you to
decide on a local page. It also finds near-duplicate tests and asks whether to
merge them.

**Install:** `kempt apply -manifest cmd/cull/kempt.toml -packages cull`. This
installs the binary and registers the `cull` channel for Claude Code and pi.
Then run `cull init` in each project: the first time it stores your TypeSafe
key (once per machine); in each project it asks whether that project may send
test code to Jev, and adds `.cull/` to the project's ignore file.

**Commands**

- `cull check` judges the tests (the whole suite, or only your diff) and writes `.cull/last.json`.
- `cull apply` removes the tests judged cut, tidies imports, verifies, and rolls back if that fails.
- `cull serve` opens the review page (starting the local server if needed).
- `cull wait` waits until you send your answers, then prints what to do.
- `cull time` runs the project's checks the way CI does, with timing, and reports where the time goes (see "Speed" below).
- `cull doctor` checks the key, whether the project allows sending test source to TypeSafe, python3 and node (when the project needs them), the test command, the review page server and the agent setup. It also lists the checks cull found the project runs.
- `cull judge` is plumbing: JSONL in, JSONL out.

**What cull reads.** To know what your project runs, cull reads the project's
own files: the CI workflows, the `justfile` recipes they call, the project's own
git hooks, and `package.json` scripts. It never reads your global git hooks.
From these it learns which test commands run, with which options and in which
folder (for example, jest in `infra/cdk`), and which scripts run as checks, such
as browser probes. A command it can't make sense of is listed as not understood,
never guessed. A project with none of these is read by test-file name, as
before. `cull doctor` lists the checks it found.

**Speed.** Every `cull check` also scans for things that make checks slow. It
runs no tests and adds only seconds. Each finding has a file and line:

- fixed waits (sleeps, `waitForTimeout`, timer promises), with their length when it is written in the code;
- Go setup that stops tests running in parallel: a helper that calls `t.Setenv` and that most tests in a package use;
- browser-probe waits that fail silently (the failure is swallowed), or that pass their timeout in the wrong place so the 30 s default applies;
- screenshot-only code in probes, which checks nothing.

A wait that is there on purpose, such as a window in which nothing should
happen, is kept by putting a `cull: keep` comment on its line.

**Timing.** `cull time` (the agent's tool is `cull_time`) runs the project's
checks the way CI does, with their own options, and times them. It takes as long
as the suite, so it runs only when asked. Before each check it first runs the
commands that set up that check in the project's recipe or CI step (for example
a build), once per check, and reports their time as setup. A setup command that
fails fails that check. It reports the slowest packages, files
and tests, and setup that most tests in a package repeat. Tests that no check
covers are timed too, and marked as such. The results are printed and not
stored.

The agent fixes what cull reports. None of the speed findings goes to your
review page.

**The agent loop.** An agent in your project has six channel tools:
`cull_check`, `cull_check_group`, `cull_review`, `cull_apply` and `cull_status`,
plus `cull_time` for the timing run.
On its own it checks the tests it wrote and applies the cuts Jev is sure of. It
sends the unsure ones to the page with `cull_review` and carries on with other
work until your answers arrive.

**Working from a workspace folder.** If your agent session starts in a folder
that holds several repositories, cull works on each repository inside it: the
agent passes the repository's path to the tools, owns that repository's review,
and receives your answers for it. `cull init` at such a folder lists the
repositories to run it in.

**The page.** For each test you see the code, Jev's verdict and why, and
you choose cut or keep. Duplicate groups ask whether to merge or keep separate.
Add a note if you like, then press Send. Your answers go to the agent that is
working in the project, which applies the cuts you chose.

**Hearing the channel.** Claude Code only listens to Send when launched with
`claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:cull`. pi gets it
through `channels.tools`. For any other session, run `cull wait` in it: it
returns when you press Send.

**Where things live.** `.cull/` in the project holds the last check. Your key is
in `~/.config/cull`, the review database in `~/.local/state/cull`, and Jev's
cached answers in `~/.cache/cull`. `cull serve --stop` stops the server, but
while an agent's channel is running it starts again within seconds.

## sift

sift audits the instruction files coding agents read: each harness's global
file and skills, and every instruction file in the repos under your roots. It
finds what is too big, duplicated, stale, dead or misplaced. An agent writes
one revised version of each file with findings, and you decide each file on a
local page. What you approve becomes one pull request per repo.

**Install:** `kempt apply -manifest cmd/sift/kempt.toml -packages sift`. This
installs the binary and registers the `sift` channel for Claude Code and pi.
Then run `sift skills install`, which installs the sift skill for each agent
harness it finds, and again after each upgrade. Run `sift init --root DIR` once
to name the directories to audit. `sift doctor` checks the setup.

**Commands**

- `sift init` detects your harnesses and writes the config. It lists the repos that have an `origin/dev`, so you can set their base (below).
- `sift check` audits the files, read at each repo's fetched base, and records a round of findings.
- `sift next` and `sift propose` are the agent's loop: one file at a time, one whole revised file each.
- `sift serve` opens the review page (starting the local server if needed).
- `sift wait` waits until you press Send, then prints what to do.
- `sift apply` writes each approved file whole, one branch per repo, cut from the repo's base in a worktree, and opens a pull request with `gh`.
- `sift reconcile` checks that each branch holds exactly the approved content.
- `sift clean` removes the branches and worktrees apply made, once their pull requests are merged or closed. `--dry-run` shows the plan.
- `sift skills install` installs the skill this binary was built with.
- `sift doctor` checks the config, the roots, `gh`, the page server and the channel registrations.

**The agent loop.** An agent has seven channel tools: `sift_check`,
`sift_next`, `sift_propose`, `sift_review`, `sift_apply`, `sift_status` and
`sift_clean`. The sift skill tells it how to run a round end to end. It audits,
recommends every file, opens the page with `sift_review`, then waits for you.
After Send it applies, reports the pull requests, and cleans up once you have
merged them. Merging is always yours.

**The page.** Each file to change shows the current and recommended versions
side by side, with its findings and a diff. You pick one, or write your own,
and add a note if you like. Files the agent would leave as they are get agree
or disagree. Press Send to hand your decisions to the agent.

**Bases.** sift reads each repo at its default branch and opens its pull
request there. For a repo whose pull requests go to another branch, name it in
the config, and both the audit and apply use it:

    [[repo]]
    path = "~/src/app"
    base = "dev"

A skill or global file that is a symlink into a git repo (a dotfiles repo, say)
is read at that repo's base and written in that repo, on its own branch.

**Hearing the channel.** Claude Code only listens to Send when launched with
`claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:sift`. pi gets it
through `channels.tools`. For any other session, run `sift wait` in it: it
returns when you press Send.

**Where things live.** The config is `~/.config/sift/config.toml`, and the
rounds, decisions and the record of what apply created are in
`~/.local/state/sift`. `sift serve --stop` stops the server.

## Releasing

Each tool releases independently via a prefixed tag:

    git tag scratch/v0.16.0 && git push origin scratch/v0.16.0
    git tag proj/v0.1.0    && git push origin proj/v0.1.0

That builds and publishes **only** the tagged tool (darwin/linux × arm64/amd64),
leaving every other tool untouched.
