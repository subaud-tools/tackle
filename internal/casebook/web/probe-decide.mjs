// probe-decide.mjs — the decide step (recommend-and-decide Task 3), run by
// probe.mjs with its check helpers (t.check, t.checkList, t.until,
// t.eventually).
//
// One serve of its own (serve.mjs: --no-open, CASEBOOK_NO_BROWSER=1, the
// hermetic git guard, the fake gh) with a repo of its own: issues and a pull
// request by other people, so they wait on Court. The fixture's own new
// items are decided first, so "new" holds this repo's items only.
//
//   the question, from serve, per kind
//   the decide row above the recommendation; the recommended button marked
//   one click decides, with no sheet; a number key picks a button
//   Not now: a condition picked from chips; "when a PR merges…" searches
//     the tracked items (a title finds the PR) or takes a pasted URL (an
//     untracked PR is offered as not tracked); junk offers and decides nothing;
//     options shown for older text can't be chosen once the text changes
//   a Not now naming a PR a sync couldn't find comes back, saying why
//   the next undecided item opens; the last shows the view's summary
//   u undoes the last decision; a decision changed since is refused (409),
//     even in the same second; u after a re-decide puts the previous back,
//     and is refused too when the item changed since
//   a live decide elsewhere doesn't skip the item after it
//
// And move-on past the first page, on a serve and repo of their own: with
// more than a page of items, deciding one on page two opens the next one on
// page two; › on page one's last row loads page two and opens its first.
//
// And the closing comment and the GitHub link (casebook 0.4.1), on a serve
// and repo of their own:
//
//   the kicker's key links to the item's GitHub page (an issue, a PR, a
//     repo) in a new tab; a branch's is plain text; the kicker stays mono
//     and muted
//   choosing Close opens a closing-comment field under the cards and
//     decides nothing; Esc cancels it; a number key opens it too
//   "close with this comment" (and ↵) records the text as the decision's
//     note; To apply's step posts exactly that text
//   "close without comment" records no note; the step has no comment
//
// And what Leave it open leaves behind (casebook 0.4.3), on a serve and repo
// of their own:
//
//   deciding Leave it open moves the row into the left-open group at the
//     bottom (its header "left open", N; collapsed until clicked; rows
//     muted, "left open · date"); the view's
//     count drops; move-on opens the next undecided item, never a
//     left-open row
//   opening a left-open row shows its decision (the chosen card) and the
//     cards as usual
//   someone else's newer comment (the GitHub cache, then a restart) moves
//     it back up to the top, flagged "new activity since you left it
//     open", counted again; Court's own newer comment doesn't
//
// And the groups (the grouped list), on a serve and repo of their own:
//
//   groups: headers in serve's order, with counts; each group's rows under
//     its header, giving the recommendation's reason in agent colour
//   each group's buttons: its choice (the primary), Discard; no Look into;
//     the not recommended only "ask agent to suggest rules", its message
//     with the list's not recommended group attached
//   the summary in the middle pane: N to decide, a line per group, discard all
//   the group's checkbox ticks all of it; untick; collapse and expand
//   groups: ticks scope per group: 3 ticked in Close and Merge's one give
//     "Close 3" and "Merge it", each accepting exactly its own
//   groups: emptied group goes after its accept, from the live event
//   groups: none group asks: the message reaches the attached session only
//
// And a group bigger than a page: "Close all 250" posts all 250 ids.
//
// And "group by recommendation" (casebook 0.6), on a serve and repo of their
// own, issues updated in number order (newest last):
//
//   the switch shows in the list, on; the first group is serve's first,
//     the not recommended (its newest item is the newest)
//   off: the address says ?flat, no group heads, the rows serve's flat
//     order (group=false), a recommended row naming its choice
//   a reload keeps it off; an old #/attention lands on #/decide keeping the
//     stored choice; the switch groups it again; #/attention/waiting lands
//     on #/decide
//
// And the item page and its buttons (casebook 0.10), on a serve and repos of
// their own:
//
//   what it is, then decide, then reading: kicker < title < facts < decide
//     row < reason < description < history; the row keeps its place and
//     height across items; nothing in the page scrolls on its own; no
//     accept, reject or change… anywhere; each button's hover is serve's
//     says, the recommended one marked
//   the recommended button accepts (POST /proposals/accept); another
//     decides differently (POST /proposals/change) and the rule's record
//     says decided differently 1
//   an outward decision moves on and the strip says "Closed it · waiting in
//     apply · undo" for 6 s; its undo restores the item; a group's "Delete
//     all 3" says "Deleted all 3 · waiting in apply · undo", and its undo
//     returns all 3 to the group
//
// And a new recommendation on the open item (casebook 0.4.5), on a serve
// and repo of their own:
//
//   the agent proposes for the open item: its recommendation card (with the
//     reason) and the "recommended" mark show, with no reload
//   a proposal for another item leaves the open item as it was
//   with the closing comment typed, or the Not now picker open, the open
//     item isn't re-rendered under Court: "openrec recommends ‹label› · show"
//     shows instead, and "show" re-renders it
//   the card's head names the session ("openrec recommends"), then the
//     choice: "Close it without merging"
//
// And "Look into it" (casebook 0.4.5; a card since 0.4.6), on a serve and
// repo of their own:
//
//   with no session attached there is no Look into it card, and no "Look
//     into all N" on its group
//   with one, the card is the last in the grid, numbered after the
//     decisions (6 on a PR, 5 on an issue), the same size as its
//     neighbours, with the agent's amber left edge and number line
//   its number key sends exactly the ask, the item attached, to that
//     session's thread only, and decides nothing
//   while the message is queued (and worked on), the item says "‹session›
//     is looking into it" under its question, and its row says so (muted,
//     agent colour); the card says it in place of its sentence and can't
//     be clicked
//   the agent's evidence and recommendation show on the open item with no
//     reload; its reply clears the marker
//   no group offers "Look into all N"; in the not recommended, ticked items
//     get "ask agent to recommend these": one message naming them, all
//     attached, and their rows show the marker; no button names the session
//
// And discarding recommendations, on a serve and repo of their own, every
// item recommended:
//
//   the summary: "5 to decide" and a line per group of the session's, and
//     "discard all 5"; its confirm, "Discard 5 recommendations in the list? …",
//     with discard and cancel; cancel changes nothing
//   discard: the rows lose their reasons, one group is left (the not
//     recommended), nothing is decided, and casebook_next hands the items
//     out again
//   groups: discard confirm: a group's Discard withdraws only that group
//
// And the steady list, on a serve and repo of their own:
//
//   no filter chips; the left-open group last, collapsed, no checkbox,
//     expanding on a click; no Look into on any group, left open none
//     either, once a session is attached after load, nothing
//     ticked; rows indented under their header's label; every row one
//     height, a long reason cut at two lines; the list's scrollbar room
//     kept (measured with a classic 15px scrollbar); a group's button line
//     one height, ticked or not
//
// And the item page and its navigation, on a serve and repos of their own:
//
//   the list 520px wide, with a classic 15px scrollbar; every row fits its
//     height (a long repo name's kicker is one line); every group's button
//     line is one line at 520px, ticked or not; a collapsed group is one line, its hint and
//     buttons hidden
//   the « ‹ › » row: the item's place in its group; « and ‹ disabled on
//     the first item; each tooltip names its target; ] into a collapsed
//     group expands it and opens its first item; [, › and ‹; the row stays
//     at the top while the item scrolls
//   the recommendation under the decide row ("‹session› recommends", the
//     choice, the reason), none where there is none; the buttons in the
//     row, one height, inside the column (wrapping inside the row's fixed
//     height when narrow); the row doesn't move between items
//   the list collapses to a 34px rail, kept across a reload; the item page
//     is then 1060px wide
//
// And a reload with pages loaded, on a serve and repo of their own:
//
//   reload keeps 600 rows: three pages shown, opening the 550th row's item
//     and a live event reload the list with every page it had, the open
//     row and its « ‹ › » row still on screen
